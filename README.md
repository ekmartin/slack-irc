## Demo

## Installation and usage
Either by installing through npm:
```bash
$ npm install -g slack-irc
$ slack-irc --config /path/to/config.json
```

or by cloning the repository:

```bash
In the repository folder:
$ npm install
$ node index.js --config /path/to/config.json
```

It can also be used as a node module:
```js
var slackIRC = require('slack-irc');
var config = require('./config.json');
slackIRC(config);
```

## Configuration

slack-irc uses Slack's [bot users](https://api.slack.com/bot-users).
This means you'll have to set up a bot user as a Slack integration, and invite it
to the Slack channels you want it to listen in on. This can be done using Slack's `/invite <botname>`
command. This has to be done manually as there's no way to do it through the Slack bot user API at
the moment.

slack-irc requires a JSON-configuration file, whose path can be given either through
the CLI-option `--config` or the environment variable `CONFIG_FILE`. The configuration
file needs to be an object or an array, depending on the number of IRC bots you want to run.

This allows you to use one instance of slack-irc for multiple Slack teams if wanted, even
if the IRC channels are on different networks.

To set the log level to debug, export the environment variable `NODE_ENV` as `development`.

slack-irc also supports invite-only IRC channels, and will join any channels it's invited to
as long as they're present in the channel mapping.

### Example configuration
```js
[
  // Bot 1 (minimal configuration):
  {
    "nickname": "test2",
    "server": "irc.testbot.org",
    "token": "slacktoken2",
    "channelMapping": {
      "#other-slack": "#new-irc-channel"
    }
  },

  // Bot 2 (advanced options):
  {
    "nickname": "test",
    "server": "irc.bottest.org",
    "token": "slacktoken", // Your bot user's token
    "autoSendCommands": [ // Commands that will be sent on connect
      ["PRIVMSG", "NickServ", "IDENTIFY password"],
      ["MODE", "test", "+x"],
      ["AUTH", "test", "password"]
    ],
    "channelMapping": { // Maps each Slack-channel to an IRC-channel, used to direct messages to the correct place
      "#slack": "#irc channel-password", // Add channel keys after the channel name
      "privategroup": "#other-channel" // No hash in front of private groups
    },
    "ircOptions": { // Optional node-irc options
      "floodProtection": false, // On by default
      "floodProtectionDelay": 1000, // 500 by default
      "welcomeMessage": "When a new user joins, this is the message they'll see."  // false by default
    },
    // Makes the bot hide the username prefix for messages that start
    // with one of these characters (commands):
    "commandCharacters": ["!", "."]
  }
]
```

`ircOptions` is passed directly to node-irc ([available options](http://node-irc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/API.html#irc.Client)).

## Tests

```bash
$ make test
```
