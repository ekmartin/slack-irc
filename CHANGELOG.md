# Changelog
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [3.8.2] - 2016-09-05
## Fixed
- Upgraded dependencies.
ESLint has dropped support for older Node.js versions,
which means you'll require at least Node.js 4.0 to develop
on slack-irc. It'll still be possible to run the application
with older Node.js versions.
- Removed unused `emoji.json` file.

## [3.8.1] - 2016-05-21
## Fixed
- Exit the application if the maximum retry count for IRC is reached.

## [3.8.0] - 2016-04-30
## Added
- The configuration option `avatarUrl`, which lets you decide
how IRC users' messages should be presented on Slack.
This can be set to `false` to disable them altogether, or
a custom URL to change the avatar.

Example: `'https://robohash.org/$username.png'`, where
$username will be replaced with the IRC author's username.

## Fixed
- Upgraded dependencies.

## [3.1.0] - 2015-03-27
### Added
- Make the bot able to join password protected IRC channels. Example:

```json
"channelMapping": {
  "#slack": "#irc channel-password",
}
```

## [3.0.0] - 2015-03-24
### Changed
Move from using outgoing/incoming integrations to Slack's
[bot users](https://api.slack.com/bot-users). See
[README.md](https://github.com/ekmartin/slack-irc/blob/master/README.md)
for a new example configuration. This mainly means slack-irc won't need
to listen on a port anymore, as it uses websockets to receive the messages
from Slack's [RTM API](https://api.slack.com/rtm).

To change from version 2 to 3, do the following:
- Create a new Slack bot user (under integrations)
- Add its token to your slack-irc config, and remove
the `outgoingToken` and `incomingURL` config options.

### Added
- Message formatting, follows Slack's [rules](https://api.slack.com/docs/formatting).
